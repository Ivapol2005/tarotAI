# üó∫Ô∏è Tarot Insight AI Roadmap

## üåü Project Vision
An open-source playground for Tarot enthusiasts, developers, and data nerds. We combine:
- AI-powered card readings
- Anonymous research to explore "Do Scorpios really get The Death card more often?"
- Your choice of interface: CLI for coders, pretty web UI for everyone else.

## üõ†Ô∏è Phases

    ```python
    def interpret_card(card: str, position: str, question: str = None) -> str:
        # Returns AI-generated interpretation**
    ```

    Text of prompt should look like this:
    ```Text
